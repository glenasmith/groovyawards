        How does all this work?
    </h4>
    <p>
        Glen &amp; Sven from the <a href="http://hansamann.podspot.de/">Grails Podcast</a> wanted a way to recognise the good work that a
        bunch of people are doing in our community, so it seemed right to invent an award. :-)
    </p>
    <p>
        The community has a month to come up with a set of people that they think are worthy of
        nomination for an award, and they can attached some info telling us why.
    </p>
    <p>
        We'll then come up with a shortlist of names out of that list which we think represents the
        community's thinking. Then we'll get together with a few luminaries at 2GX and
        come up with the final list.
    </p>
    <p>
        Winners will be notified via the podcast and will get a token gift that Glen and Sven
        will organise.
